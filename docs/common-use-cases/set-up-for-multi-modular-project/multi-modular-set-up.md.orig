# Setting-up for a Multi-Modular Project

When dealing with a multi-modular architecture, efficient app navigation is crucial for maintaining a clean and scalable codebase while removing the code complexities.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is achievable by with Compose Destinations by following these steps for Kotlin DSL.

:::note
This is only applicable in version 1 of Compose Destinations Library which can be replaced by a superior future version.
:::

**Adding Compose Destination Dependency, KSP and Parcelize Plugins to the Base Module**

You need to apply the KSP plugin on your `gradle.build.kts` ( project--level ). 

You can find the [Latest KSP Version](https://github.com/google/ksp/releases) on GitHub. Depending on your Compose Version you may need to [choose the respective](https://github.com/raamcosta/compose-destinations#2-add-the-dependencies) Compose Destinations Library Version to load onto your project

```kotlin

//Apply ksp and parcelize plugins on gradle.build (project level)

<<<<<<< HEAD
We add Androidx Navigation and Animation libs to take advantage of Navigation component’s infrastructure and features e.g. the NavController. Please also note prior Accompanist's Navigation and Animation Libraries have since been deprecated in favor of Androidx Libraries.

**Configure gradle files for the other modules**

The main idea behind Compose Destinations is get rid of boilerplate code. You need this set-up on your modules to help with Code Generation behind the scenes.

Depending on your modularization strategy this set-up will only apply to your feature modules which is where navigation takes place.

```kotlin
//apply ksp plugin as usual - this example uses version catalog
=======
We add official Navigation and Animation libs to take advantage of Navigation component’s infrastructure and features e.g. the `NavController`.

:::note

Prior Accompanist's [Navigation](https://google.github.io/accompanist/navigation-material/) and [Animation](https://google.github.io/accompanist/navigation-animation/) libraries have since been deprecated in favor of `Androidx` libraries.

**Configuring gradle files for the other modules**

The main idea behind Compose Destinations is getting rid of boilerplate code using code generation under the hood.

Depending on your modularization strategy this set-up `gradle` set-up only applies to the feature modules which is where navigation takes place.

```kotlin
// apply ksp plugin - this example uses version catalog
>>>>>>> pr/17

plugins {
    alias(libs.plugins.com.android.library)
    alias(libs.plugins.org.jetbrains.kotlin.android)
    alias(libs.plugins.com.google.devtools.ksp)

    ksp(libs.compose.destinations.ksp)
```

According to [the docs](https://composedestinations.rafaelcosta.xyz/codegenconfigs/#multi-module-configs), `GENERATION_MODE_FOR_MODULE` can be replaced with:

- `"destinations":` KSP will generate the destinations of the module and expose a list with all of them.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- `"navgraphs":` The module will generate a nav graph and its destinations

- `"singlemodule":` Meant for apps where navigation-related code is in a single module.

In a multi-modular project we take the `destinations` option for KSP to generate the destinations.

For instance if your feature module name is `:feature:stats` you can have something like this:
=======
- `"navgraphs":` The module will generate a nav graph and its destinations.

- `"singlemodule":` Meant for apps where navigation-related code is in a single module.

In a multi-modular project go for `destinations` option for KSP to generate the destinations.

For a feature module with a name of `:feature:stats` you can have something like this:
>>>>>>> pr/17

```kotlin
 ksp {
        arg("compose-destinations.mode", "destinations")
        arg("compose-destinations.moduleName", "stats")
        
    }

```
<<<<<<< HEAD

Build the project (or run `./gradlew kspDebugKotlin`from the terminal) to generate all the destinations.

**Example of usage:** Tonnie's [CountriesPad Project](https://github.com/Tonnie-Dev/CountriesPad/blob/master/feature/stats/build.gradle.kts) -
I used the `destinations` option and KSP generated the destinations of the home module exposing a list of home module destinations. 

However, `destinations` option doesn't generate any NavGraphs.

**Building the NavGraphs Object**

The NavGraph is an object and it is recommended to have a globally accessible object containing the NavGraphs. 

This should be created inside your base module where you plan to have the Navigation package. The navigation package typically resides in the app module. 
=======
In this example *GENERATION_MODE_FOR_MODULE* placeholder is replaced with *destinations* while *stats* replaces *YOUR_MODULE_NAME* placeholder.

Build the project ( or run `./gradlew kspDebugKotlin` from the terminal ) to generate all the destinations.

However, `destinations` option doesn't generate any `NavGraphs`; this will need to be created manually.

This object gathers the Navgraphs from other modules into a single "top-level" navigation graph to pass to `DestinationsNavHost` call.

**Conditional Navigation**

Inside the NavGrapphsYou can also write a helper function to figure out which screen to show first e.g. if the user is not authenticated then you need to present the Authentication Screen first otherwise the user should be redirected to the next screen on your setup.

>>>>>>> pr/17

The class takes NavController parameter ( *from androidx.navigation.NavController*) on its constructor.

The `navController` is then used alongside Compose Destinations' `navigate()` function to accomplish navigation. The `navigate()` function ( *not navigateTo( )* function ) takes the KSP-generated destination instead of a String route.

```kotlin
import androidx.navigation.NavController
import com.ramcosta.composedestinations.navigation.navigate

class CoreNavigator(private val navController: NavController) : OverviewScreenNavigator{

    override fun navigateBackToOverviewScreen() {
        navController.navigate(OverviewScreenDestination)
    }

    override fun navigateToDetailsScreen(country: Country) {
        navController.navigate(DetailsScreenDestination(country))
    }

}

**Transitions Functions**
=======
**Creating Transitions**
>>>>>>> pr/17

Transitions are `enter`, `exit` and `pop` animations that are applied when navigating between different destinations within your app. They enhance the user experience by providing smooth visual effects when moving from one screen to another. 

Android provides a framework for specifying these transitions through the AndroidX Navigation component.

<<<<<<< HEAD
In compose the navition transitions are still experimental but you can refer to the below example on compose navigations animations.

Compose Destinations has a "NavHost-like" Composable that you can use as a base for all your screens.
